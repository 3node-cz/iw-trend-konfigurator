## Project Overview

This is a cutting configurator e-shop application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The application helps users configure material cutting orders with automatic price calculation and PDF generation.

## Key Features

- **Material cutting configurator**: Allows users to specify dimensions, material type, edge processing, and other details
- **Automatic price calculation**: Real-time price calculations based on user inputs
- **PDF generation**: Creates PDF attachments for orders
- **Geometric calculations**: Client-side material consumption calculations
- **User-friendly interface**: Intuitive UI with visualization of individual parts
- **Export functionality**: Automatic data export in supplier-required format

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use modern CSS/styling approaches (CSS modules, styled-components, or similar)
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Write clean, documented code with clear naming conventions

## Architecture Notes

- Keep business logic separate from UI components
- Use custom hooks for complex state management
- Implement proper form validation
- Consider performance for real-time calculations
- Structure components for reusability
